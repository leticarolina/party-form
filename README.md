# Party Form

## Overview

I made the "Party Form" as my first project to use some Bootstrap styles I learned in my course. This is a one-page form for signing up for an online party, with different types of input.

It was fairly quick to finish because it's straightforward and Bootstrap made it easier. But I think the styles might have some limits. I plan to do more projects with Bootstrap to learn more about what it can do.
